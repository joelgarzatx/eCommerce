* Code

* Two-page project write-up

## Code

Given most students selected PHP to implement the eCommerce site, the instructions will be based on that. If you used something else, do you best to apply the guidance to your situation, and ask for help if you need it.

Locate the folder that contains your PHP code. For example, on my site, there is a folder named htdocs and I have a sub-folder named ecommerce. The ecommerce folders contains all of the files needed for my project. Create a zip archive of the folder that contains all of your project files. 

## SQL for Database

In XAMPP, or your host, look for and launch myPHPAdmin. You are going to use the Export function to create an SQL export of your database, which will include statements that will enable someone to recreate your database structure and populate the database with the same set of data you have. You may need to update your data if you've been testing and need to restock or add additional items for proper testing of your site.

1. Launch/log in to phpMyAdmin
2. Select your database from the navigation panel on the left hand side.
3. Click the Export tab along the top of the main panel.
4. In the "Exporting tables" dialog, choose the Quick Export Method and choose SQL for the Format, then click the Go button.
5. A file download should begin for the SQL that is created. Pay attention to where the file is saved and move it to the same location as your zipped code.

If you did not use MySQL or do not have access to phpMyAdmin, please find another way to provide the SQL to create the tables and populate with test data.

## Project write-up

Include a brief (page or so) project summary:

1. Describe your store and the types of products sold (this can be from your product pitch)
2. Describe the technology stack, ex. XAMPP/PHP or whatever you used
3. Include any special notes for setting up and testing your site

Save a copy of the project summary and move it to the same location as your zipped code and SQL file.
