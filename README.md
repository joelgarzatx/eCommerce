repository for eCommerce web store project


# What is this?

The approach I hoped to use was proving to be a bit tricky and we don't have the luxury of time to hold out. This site is called "GitHub" and is a web-hosted version control system, used by developers to track versions of and updates to code, individually or as a team.

The "repository" of interest for the CSCI 6314 class will be the [eCommerce repository](https://github.com/joelgarzatx/eCommerce). This is where you will find updates and any sample/supporting files I include. As the repository is public, you do not need to create a GitHub account. You will be able to see files that are updated in the dashboard, and there's even a way to view the changes between updates. The more advanced features or trying to use GitHub yourself is left as an exercise on your own (probably after the class).

# What next?

I am going to make some brief notes on one approach to build a project according to the requirements discussed in class. It is not the only way, and likely not the way one would do professionally, but it may help guide some who get stuck thinking about it.

I will put a task plan in a file called [taskplan.md](https://github.com/joelgarzatx/eCommerce/blob/master/taskplan.md). Files ending in .md are text files using a type of formatting that can be translated into HTML using a markup named Markdown. If you view these online, GitHub will show the document as HTML. If you download, just open in a text editor to view the text version.

Comments will be added journal-style to a file called [project_notes.md](https://github.com/joelgarzatx/eCommerce/blob/master/project_notes.md).
