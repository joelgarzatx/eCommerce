repository for eCommerce web store project


# What is this?

The approach I hoped to use was proving to be a bit tricky and we don't have the luxury of time to hold out. This site is called "GitHub" and is a web-hosted version control system, used by developers to track versions of and updates to code, individually or as a team.

The "repository" of interest for the CSCI 6314 class will be the [eCommerce repository](https://github.com/joelgarzatx/eCommerce). This is where you will find updates and any sample/supporting files I include. As the repository is public, you do not need to create a GitHub account. You will be able to see files that are updated in the dashboard, and there's even a way to view the changes between updates. The more advanced features or trying to use GitHub yourself is left as an exercise on your own (probably after the class).
