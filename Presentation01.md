# Sizing User Stories

* User stories can be written at varying levels of detail.
* Stories that cover a large amount of functionality are know as _epics_.
* Epics are too large for an agile team to complete in one iteration, and are split into smaller user stories before it is worked on.

----

# Adding Detail to User Stories

Detail is added in two ways:
* Splitting a user story into multiple, smaller user stories
* Adding "conditions of satisfaction".

A "condition of satisfaction" is a high-level acceptance test that will be true after the agile user story is complete.

* Very high level, so break it down.
* As a user, I want to view the available products, so that I can add to my shopping cart.
* As a user, I want to know which products are in inventory and which are out-of-stock, so I don't have to wait for back-order.
* As a user, I want to be able to check out using a credit card, so I can pay for my order.
* As an admin, I want to be able to add new inventory to stock.
* As an admin, I want to be able to view a report of items sold by month.
